After one year absence from doing radio, djing and basically any other form of musical
activity - due to housebuilding - I am finally ready to continue my beloved radio show
Foundation Sound on [Radio Proton](http://radioproton.at) where I left off. I'm more
than lucky that I even got the same time slot - **Friday night 9pm till midnight** every
4th week - thanks to the support of Monika who is coordinating the programme at the
local radio station.

> The first show will take place on **January 4, 2019 9pm CET**.

In terms of content, not much will change to the format prior to my break: **Dubstep and
Sound System Culture** are still the main focus. However, everthing between Roots Music,
Dub and Jungle - music that is built upon the foundation of bass - goes hand in hand.
The main goal for 2019 is to improve the show on various levels: musical selection,
interviews, guest mixes, audio documentaries, and so on.  As a first step I decided to
put up this blog to document all shows - which I tried to do in the past already, but
did not continue consequently.

Follow me on Twitter [@chaudum](https://twitter.com/chaudum) and
[@apoxiddub](https://twitter.com/apoxiddub) to get additional information about the
shows.
